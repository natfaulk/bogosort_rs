# Rust Bogosort
I have just started learning rust, so I thought this would make an interesting program to write.
A bogosort is where one rearranges the items to be sorted and checks them to see if they are sorted.
This process is repeated until a permutation where the data is sorted is found.
Obviously it is a totally unfeasible algorithm for real world as it has truly woeful complexity.

I plan to optimise the bogosort to make less awful (but still a bogosort).
The motivation behind this is mainly to improve my rust skills but also as an interesting exercise
to see how much the bogosort could be improved.
